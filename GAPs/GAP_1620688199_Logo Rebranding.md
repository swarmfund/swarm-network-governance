# Logo rebranding 

## Description of the proposed Governance Action
Changing the bird logo to a bee logo. 
## Purpose and rationale for the Governance Action and its intended outcomes
After speaking with the CEO of Binance, we were told that the bird in Swarm leads to confusion and should be replaced with the English term "Swarm"(bee). Unification of the logo with the project name "Swarm", presents a consistent appearance to potential Exchanges and customers.
