# Swarm Masternodes Fund

## Description of the proposed change to Swarm Network Policy

- From every monthly reward from the masternodes pool, a chosen %  will be sent upfront to a secure wallet for the agreed amount of time.

A) Yes, for 3 years;

B) Yes, for 5 years;

C) No, I disapprove of this action;


- If option A or B are selected, the monthly percentage rate delivered to the Swarm Masternodes Fund (SMF) will be:

A) 12.5%; 

B) 10%; 

C) 5% + 2.5% for each following year up to a maximum of 15%, regardless of the duration of this initiative.


This particular GAP only focuses on approving the creation of the SMF to begin saving as soon as possible while the rewards pool is still fairly large. It DOES NOT set rules regarding when or how the funds will be used.
 
Deployment of funds will be decided with dedicated proposals. If a future GAP will be approved to entirely cancel the SMF, the tokens in the SMF will be sent to the wallets originally meant to receive them. However, this restitution action will bear a small cost which will be included in its dedicated proposal and be paid with the funds by then accrued within the SMF. 

Data available at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx5krx-mPaxVYQsyusGHkbWDYWIdCS5c2EUyV9h-gLU/edit?usp=sharing

Any of the above rules can be amended in the future by a new GAP.

If this current proposal is agreed upon, the Swarm Network will aim to implement the changes and start the Swarm Masternodes Fund between the end of February and the end of March 2020. 

It will require the creation of a multisig Ethereum address administered and protected by the Swarm Council. It will need at least 3 signatures or a similarly secure protection in accordance to the Swarm Network’s own standards. 

The community is to be made aware of the identity of those Council members holding the signatures to the Swarm Masternodes Fund. 

The Ethereum wallet containing the Swarm Masternodes Fund will be made public.
 

## Purpose and rationale for the policy change and its intended outcomes

Despite the number of nodes possibly changing with time, the percentage of yearly rewards set aside for the Swarm Masternodes Fund is expected to remain fixed at the chosen rate for the chosen amount of time, as it is simply a percentage of the total monthly pool, irrespective of the number of active nodes.

Each node will be short of barely 2000 SWM tokens (likely less) across the total 5-year period, in order to save up to 700,000+ SWM overall.

The Swarm Masternodes Fund would foster a climate of collaboration between members, nurturing engagement and the discussion of ideas enriching the network’s strength, development and reach.

I would like to remind the community that the real goal of masternodes isn’t to only receive decreasing yearly rewards, but to process an increasing number of MAP (Market Access Protocol) transactions. Therefore, I find it very beneficial in the long-term to begin saving a few SWM tokens independent from the Swarm Treasury itself, with the goal of fostering adoption, utility and development.


## Additional information for Governance Actions requiring the expenditure of Swarm Treasury funds

It will bear no cost as any necessary change to the Masternode rewards delivery will be done in-house by developers of the Swarm Network community.
